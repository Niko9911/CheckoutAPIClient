This is API client for the Finnish payment gateway Checkout Finland. This can be used
only with Checkout Finland.

There is two versions from this API client. One is available as PHP-library via composer.
Another is written on C and is available as PHP-extension. PHP-extension might be
little bit faster than PHP-library. At end, both do same.
